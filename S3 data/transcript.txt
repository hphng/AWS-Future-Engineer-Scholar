Arin: I never imagined the Valley of Echoes would look like this. It feels alive, as if it is watching us.

Lira: That is because it probably is. Old magic lingers in places like this. The ground remembers every battle and every mistake.

Arin: You sound unusually serious today.

Lira: I am serious when the situation requires it. Especially when we are walking straight toward a villain who can bend shadows with his thoughts.

Arin: You mean Morvath.

Lira: Yes. Him. I still cannot understand why someone with his intelligence chooses destruction.

Arin: He believes the world must be controlled to be saved.

Lira: Then he has forgotten what it means to protect. Control is easy. Protection requires sacrifice.

Arin: I worry that I am not strong enough to face him.

Lira: Listen to me. Power alone is not what decides battles in stories like ours. Your heart is stubborn. You stand back up even when the world knocks you down. That is why you matter.

Arin: You think that is enough?

Lira: I know it is. Besides, you have us. You are not fighting alone.

Arin: Still, Morvath grows stronger with every hour. We must reach the vault before he does.

Lira: And we will. But you cannot carry this fear by yourself. Speak it aloud. What troubles you most?

Arin: That when the Heart of Dawn calls, it will choose wrong. Or worse, it will choose me and I will fail everyone.

Lira: Then let it choose. And if it chooses you, trust that the magic knows something you do not. Look at me, Arin. You are not the frightened apprentice you were when we first met. You have grown into someone the Heart can rely on.

Arin: I want to believe you.

Lira: Then believe me. I do not flatter people. Ask Seron. He still insists I have never given him a compliment.

Arin: That is probably true.

Lira: See? Now stop doubting yourself. When Morvath appears, stand firm. Do not hesitate. Darkness thrives on hesitation.

Arin: And what about you? You are walking into as much danger as I am.

Lira: I handle danger one blade swing at a time. You handle it with light and stubbornness. Together, we make a decent team.

Arin: A strange team.

Lira: The best stories always start with strange teams. Now come on. The others are waiting, and Morvath never gives us the courtesy of arriving late.
